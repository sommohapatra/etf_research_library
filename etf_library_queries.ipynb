      "Yes, managing proxy voting can be a difficult process for advisers. Advisers must ensure that they are voting proxies in the best interest of their clients, which can be difficult to determine. They must also be aware of any potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with proxy voting. Additionally, advisers must be able to provide clients with a concise summary of their proxy voting process and offer to provide copies of the complete proxy voting policy and procedures upon request. Furthermore, advisers must be able to disclose to clients how they may obtain information regarding voted proxies. Additionally, advisers must be able to provide investors with adequate disclosure as to how final votes are aligned with any proxy advisor employed by their investment manager. This includes disclosing how often their final votes aligned with any proxy advisor they employed, as well as to disclose what percentage of proxy advisor recommendations were reviewed internally by an investment manager. Advisers must also be aware of the proxy advisory firms that dominate the industry, such as ISS and Glass-Lewis, and the business model of these firms. All of these tasks can be time-consuming and difficult to manage.\n"

And what I like about this industry is this cookbook was written in the ’90s, where everybody just paid lawyers and paid third parties and margins were much fatter, so no one looked at it. So, you have the way, “Things are supposed to be done.” And then you say, “Well, I know that doesn’t take that much time. I know this can be done with a computer, I know this part I can do myself, and you can get a proxy process that’s supposed to cost a quarter-million dollars, you can get that down to 80. That’s what I like about my job is you can find these things that there’s just so much fat on them. And with a little bit of wringing the towel, you can get it down to a more affordable.', lookup_str='', metadata={'title': 'all_things_etfs_meb_faber.txt'}, lookup_index=0),\n",

And when we did it, my hack was, because you guys are kind of brothers from another mother with being value-conscious, aka cheap bastards. And when we had to do proxy, and I was looking at some of these checks, we were going to have to write, I was like, “Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we got to find out a different solution.” And we had found an automated call center that would call all of our shareholders for like, 1/20 the cost and I just recorded a message. I was like, “Hey, this is Meb. You’re a shareholder in one of our funds.” And just recorded it and it was infinitely more effective than whatever process they had, which cost a gazillion dollars. But listeners, if you got a start-up that’s disrupting any of this hit me up because it’s, what a nightmare.', lookup_str='', metadata={'title': 'all_things_etfs_meb_faber.txt'}, lookup_index=0),\n",
