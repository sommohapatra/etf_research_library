NYSE Ends Broker Discretionary Voting for Certain Corporate Governance Proposals (January 27, 2012)

The New York Stock Exchange has announced that, in keeping with recent Congressional
and public policy trends disfavoring broker voting of uninstructed shares (including the
elimination of such voting in director elections by the NYSE and the elimination of such voting
on executive compensation matters by the Dodd-Frank Act), the Exchange would end its prior
policy of allowing broker voting on certain corporate governance proposals that are supported
by management. Under this policy change, which is effective immediately, NYSE brokers will
no longer be able to vote uninstructed shares on such proposals, including proposals to destagger the board of directors, implement majority voting in the election of directors, eliminate
supermajority voting requirements, provide for the use of written consents, provide rights to
call a special meeting and eliminate certain anti-takeover provisions.
This change presumably will not apply to auditor ratification proposals, so broker non-votes
can still be counted as “present” at the meeting and the ability to establish a quorum should
not be affected.
Companies should note that this change could affect the outcome of votes on these types of
proposals, e.g., for companies where shareholder approval is measured by reference to
shares entitled to vote on the matter, broker non-votes would function as a “no” vote.
Companies listed on NASDAQ will also be impacted by these rules, as the change applies to
NYSE brokers, not solely to NYSE-listed companies.
